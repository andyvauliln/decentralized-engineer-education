# Brandon's Take On A Decentralized Engineering Education

My goals are to build 5 things:

1. A Blockchain
1. A Cryptocurrency/ICO
1. A new language
1. A compiler
1. A decentralized Wireless (Mesh) Network

## What is a Full-Stack Decentralization Engineer?

The goal is to develop the skills to bring the value of decentralization to any social organization including small-businesses, large businesses, startups, grassroots groups and organizations, political groups, activist groups, and even cities/states/countries.

My goal is to grow from a Junior Full-Stack Javascript Web Developer to a Fullstack Decentralization Engineer before my time at my Software Engineering Apprenticship program is complete. My end date here is April 6th, 2018.
